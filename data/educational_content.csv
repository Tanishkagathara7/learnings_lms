Mathematics,Algebra,"Algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. In elementary algebra, those symbols represent quantities without fixed values, known as variables. Linear equations form the foundation of algebraic thinking, where we solve for unknown variables using mathematical operations."
Mathematics,Calculus,"Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. It has two major branches: differential calculus concerning instantaneous rates of change and slopes of curves, and integral calculus concerning accumulation of quantities and areas under curves. The fundamental theorem of calculus connects these two branches."
Mathematics,Statistics,"Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. Descriptive statistics summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation. Inferential statistics draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation."
Physics,Mechanics,"Classical mechanics is a physical theory describing the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, and astronomical objects. It provides extremely accurate results when studying large objects that are not extremely massive and speeds not approaching the speed of light."
Physics,Thermodynamics,"Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation, and physical properties of matter. The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another."
Physics,Electromagnetism,"Electromagnetism is a branch of physics involving the study of the electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles. The electromagnetic force carries electromagnetic fields, composed of electric fields and magnetic fields."
Chemistry,Organic Chemistry,"Organic chemistry is a subdiscipline of chemistry that studies the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of carbon-based compounds. These compounds may contain any number of other elements, including hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and halogens."
Chemistry,Inorganic Chemistry,"Inorganic chemistry deals with the synthesis and behavior of inorganic and organometallic compounds. This field covers all chemical compounds except organic compounds. Inorganic compounds are typically classified as ionic, molecular, or metallic."
Chemistry,Physical Chemistry,"Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of the principles, practices, and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, and statistical mechanics."
Biology,Cell Biology,"Cell biology is a branch of biology studying the structure and function of the cell, the basic unit of life. Cells consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids."
Biology,Genetics,"Genetics is a branch of biology concerned with the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms. Genes are made of DNA and contain the instructions for building and maintaining an organism's cells and passing genetic traits to offspring."
Biology,Evolution,"Evolution is the change in the heritable traits of biological populations over successive generations. These traits are the expression of genes that are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction."
Computer Science,Algorithms,"An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks."
Computer Science,Data Structures,"A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types. Common examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs."
Computer Science,Programming,"Computer programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, and many others."
